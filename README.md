# *"EdocFlow"*

### **Electronic Document Management system (EDMS)**

The system was developed to solve the problem of manual (or paper) document management.<br/>

EdocFlow offers the use of digitized documents, as well as their signing through embedded logic from outside,
called [SIGEX API](https://sigex.kz/support/developers/). </br>

The integrated system will help with the implementation of signing via digital signature (ЭЦП), as well as the logic of
confirming the signed document.
